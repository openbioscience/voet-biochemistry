- Explain why knowing a protein’s amino acid sequence is required to determine its tertiary structure.
  - Experimental methods (XRC, NMR, CryoEM) are sometimes unable to distinguish between side-chains of similar size and shape (e.g. Leu, Ile, Thr, Val).

- Why do turns and loops most often occur on the protein surface?
- Which side chains usually occur on a protein’s surface? In its interior?
- Describe some of the common protein structural motifs.
- Why does a protein domain consist of at least 40 amino acid residues?
- Explain why a protein’s sequence evolves faster than its structure.
- Summarize the types of information provided in a PDB file.
- Why is it useful to compare protein structures in addition to protein sequences?

## 6.3, Quaternary Structure and Symmetry

- List the advantages of multiple subunits in proteins.
- Why can’t proteins have mirror symmetry?

## 6.4, Protein Stability

- Describe the hydropathic index plot for a fibrous protein such as collagen or keratin.
- Describe the forces that stabilize proteins, and rank their relative importance.
- Summarize the results of Anfinsen’s experiment with RNase A.
- Why would it be advantageous for a protein or a segment of a protein to lack defined secondary or tertiary structure?

## 6.5, Protein Folding

- Describe the energy and entropy changes that occur during protein folding.
- Explain why it is important for protein disulfide isomerase to catalyze both the breaking and formation of disulfide bonds.
- How does protein renaturation _in vitro_ differ from protein folding _in vivo_?
- Explain why a protein such as RNase A can be easily denatured and renatured _in vitro_, whereas most proteins that are denatured do not refold properly _in vitro_.
- Explain the role of ATP in the action of Hsp70 and GroEL/ES.
- Why would cells need more than one type of chaperone?
